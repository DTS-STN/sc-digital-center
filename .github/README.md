## Description

Digital Centre description coming soon!!!

### Technologies Used

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the front-end and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)/[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for unit testing and end-to-end testing. In addition, [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) is used for our CI/CD pipelines and deployments. [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is used in correlation with prettier to format the code on pre-commit, increasing code readability.

## How to Implement/Get Started

After cloning the repository, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Configuration

### TeamCity

Digital Centre is configured with TeamCity in a Configuration As Code approach. This allows developers to modify TeamCity configurations from the code, located in the `.teamcity/settings.kts`.

In order to set this up, in TeamCity, the VCS Root needs to be configured with the _SSH repository key_. Next, authentication needs to be configured from TeamCity to allow commits to the project. Inside of the VCS Root settings, under Authentication Settings, an _Uploaded Key_ must be added. It is important to point out that a simple username/password will not work as stated by a [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-12-git-password-authentication-is-shutting-down/) starting August 13th, 2021.

### Helm

For every Kubernetes cluster, a context.sh file needs to be defined. For example, one might be called context-dev.sh and the other context-prod.sh.

For more information, please visit the [DTS SRE deployment templates](https://github.com/DTS-STN/dts-sre-deployment-templates/tree/main/kubernetes-helm-template).

## PR Procedures

We need to have at least one person reviewing each PR before it can be merged.
Also, each _feature_ branch should be prefixed by the relevant ADO issue, if possible e.g. **66013**-comprehensive-readme.
The desciption should be kept very short, so that the dynamic build works.
